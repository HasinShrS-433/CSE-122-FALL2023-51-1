Sure, here's an example of how you can create a base class `Animal` with a virtual function `makeSound()` and derive classes `Dog` and `Cat` from it with their own implementations of `makeSound()` in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
Sure, here's an example of how you can create a base class `Animal` with a virtual function `makeSound()` and derive classes `Dog` and `Cat` from it with their own implementations of `makeSound()` in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Base class Animal
class Animal {
public:
    // Virtual function makeSound
    virtual void makeSound() {
        std::cout << "This is an animal sound." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Derived class Dog
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    // Override makeSound for Dog
    void makeSound() override {
        std::cout << "Woof! Woof!" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Derived class Cat
class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    // Override makeSound for Cat
    void makeSound() override {
        std::cout << "Meow! Meow!" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* myAnimal;
    
    myAnimal = new Dog();
    myAnimal->makeSound(); // Calls Dog's makeSound()

    myAnimal = new Cat();
    myAnimal->makeSound(); // Calls Cat's makeSound()

    delete myAnimal;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a base class `Animal` with a virtual function `makeSound()`. Then, we derive the `Dog` and `Cat` classes from `Animal` and override the `makeSound()` function in each derived class to provide specific implementations. Finally, in the `main()` function, we demonstrate how to create objects of both `Dog` and `Cat` classes and call their respective `makeSound()` functions.
// Base class Animal
class Animal {
public:
    // Virtual function makeSound
    virtual void makeSound() {
        std::cout << "This is an animal sound." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Derived class Dog
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    // Override makeSound for Dog
    void makeSound() override {
        std::cout << "Woof! Woof!" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Derived class Cat
class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    // Override makeSound for Cat
    void makeSound() override {
        std::cout << "Meow! Meow!" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* myAnimal;
    
    myAnimal = new Dog();
    myAnimal->makeSound(); // Calls Dog's makeSound()

    myAnimal = new Cat();
    myAnimal->makeSound(); // Calls Cat's makeSound()

    delete myAnimal;

    return 0;
}
```
